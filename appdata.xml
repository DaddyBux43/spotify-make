  <p>
Think of Spotify as your new music collection. Your library. Only this time
your collection is vast: millions of tracks and counting.  Spotify comes in
all shapes and sizes, available for your PC, Mac, home audio system and
mobile phone. Wherever you go, your music follows you. And because the music
plays live, thereâ€™s no need to wait for downloads and no big dent in your
hard drive. 
  </p>
  <p>
There are are two ways to listen to spotify using linux: Using the web-based
service or using this native client.
