This is an attempt to create something which installs the spotify
debian package in a distro independent way. We have two files:
configure and Makefile.in.

Although not based on automake in any way it's run in the same way
using configure, make and make install. Some examples:

Installing in system directories e. g., installing in
/opt/local/lib and /opt/local/share with a binary in /usr/bin:

   $ ./configure  --prefix=/opt --bindir=/usr/bin
   $ make
   # make install
   # make register

Installing in a temporary dir e. g. in a packaging context:

   $ ./configure --prefix=/usr
   $ make
   $ make DESTDIR=/tmp/spotify install

Making a user install without root privileges installs in
~/.local/share with a binary in ~/bin

   $ ./configure --user
   $ make
   $ make DESTDIR=/tmp/spotify install
   $ make register

Other variants are possible using e. g. the --bindir or --libdir
arguments to configure. Use configure -h to find out. The register
target notifies system about new icons etc. There is also a
'uninstall' target.
